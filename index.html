            <p>This digitization project was created for the course <i>Digitizing Cultural Hertiage</i> at Borås University. This collection consists of 18 botanical illustrations from a german textbook about botanical bilology.
            <br><br>
                The book is called <i>Underricht in der Botanik</i> by Dr. Otto Vogel, Dr. Karl Müllenhoff abd Dr. Paul Röseler. It was orginally published in in Berlin 1906 by <i>Winckelmann & Shöne</i>. The 18 illustrations chosen for this collection could be found in the back of the book. They are threcolor-prints of watercolors painted by an artist called A. Schmalfuís.
                <br><br>
                The book pages were gently removed from the book and scanned using 600dpi, and then cropped and saved as tif-files.
                
            </p>

            <p>All tif-files of the original scans have been uploaded on Google Drive and can be accessed <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1NYGRoFryEbNM8BtT2f3HETfC-MBRHPCH?usp=sharing" >here.</a></p>
